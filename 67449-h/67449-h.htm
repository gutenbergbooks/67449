<p class='c005'>In compiling the genealogical history of Laurent De
Camp, an early Huguenot emigrant to the New Netherlands,
and his descendants, I have been actuated not
only by the desire to perpetuate the memory of the first
American ancestor of an old New Jersey family, but
also to preserve for future generations manuscript
records rapidly disintegrating and in many cases inaccessible
to the general public. The early French and
Dutch church records in New York and New Jersey
have, with few exceptions, remained unprinted and
have been so carelessly kept that the writings have
almost faded away. To add to my difficulty the puzzling
method adopted by the ignorant Dutch clerks of
entering the French name “De Camp” in its Dutch
equivalents “Van Camp” and “Van Campen” has necessitated
a long and thorough search against each name in
order that no important fact concerning the De Camp
family, so erroneously recorded, might be overlooked.
Throughout this search I have found no evidence
to prove the “De Camp” and “Van Campen” families
identical or even related in any degree. I have further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>had to struggle against a curious apathy among the
present “De Camps” concerning their origin and in
several cases an absolute refusal to furnish the slightest
information about their immediate generation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The result of six years’ labor is contained in these
pages, and I trust the data collected may prove of value
to those interested in the subject, and spur them on to
further research.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some mistakes will doubtless be found throughout
the work, but all criticism and correction will be warmly
welcomed and any additional information gratefully
received.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE DE CAMP FAMILY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When the Catholic party, headed by Catherine di
Medici, culminated years of cruel persecution with the
massacre of the French Protestants on St. Bartholomew’s
Day, 24th August, 1572, a number of the surviving
Huguenots fled for safety to the Netherlands and England.
In many cases the name of illustrious families
disappear forever from the records of France only to reappear
in and flourish under the protection and religious
toleration of the Dutch and English nations. Between
the years 1572 and 1620 the names of many of the French
refugees underwent a change suitable to the environment
and in some cases became so Dutch in character
that it is extremely difficult to trace them back to the
original French. The curious custom so prevalent in
the Netherlands of using no surname and designating
as “Laurence, the son of John,” (Laurens Jansen) if
such was the father’s Christian name, renders the task
of the genealogist still more complicated, and when
added to the fact that localities and towns of the same
derivative designation exist both in France and Holland
(as the hamlet of “Camps” in France and the villages
of “Campen” in the Netherlands and Denmark),
it is small wonder that the greatest confusion prevails
as to the ancestral source of many early New Amsterdam
families. As early as 1650 the names of “De
Camp,” “Van Kamp” and “Van Campen” appear on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the church and State records of New Amsterdam and
the surrounding towns. It was long supposed that these
three families were closely related, if not identical, but
a critical examination of the records not only of the
parents and children, but also of the baptismal sponsors,
carries the conviction that the “De Camp” and the
“Van Campen” families were of different origin and
nationality. Almost all the original “De Camp”
settlers who can positively be identified and traced as
such were recorded in the Dutch church records of New
Amsterdam, Brooklyn, Flatbush, New Utrecht, and
Staten Island, under the names “Van Kamp” and
“Van Campen” by the clerks of the above several parishes.
It is only after the year 1710 that the name
begins to be written correctly as “De Camp” or
“D’Camp” on the church records.</p>

<p class='c005'>At first it was theorized that some of the early
“Van Campen” settlers were originally members of the
“De Camp” family, basing the presumption upon the
repeated recording of the name of “De Camp” in its
Dutch equivalent, but upon classifying and comparing
the names of the several sponsors at the baptism of the
“De Camp” and “Van Campen” children, the strongest
evidence is found to sustain the statement that the
two families were nowise related by blood or marriage,
the one being of French and the other of Dutch origin.
As a matter of general interest, however, and for the
sake of more complete record some few facts concerning
the “Van Campen”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a> family are given in the foot-notes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and the genealogical student can thus verify the above
statement and draw his own conclusions. Every effort
has been made by the compiler to trace the “De Camp”
name in France, but a thorough search in the archives
of the “Bibliotheque Nationale” at Paris, and of the
Department du Pas de Calais at Arras, fails to disclose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>any information of direct bearing upon the American
families of “De Camp.” For the purpose of record
however, the following facts may be of interest. The
name “De or Du Camp, Camps and Campe,” also
“Decamp” appear in the records of the cities of Laon,
Rosay, Rouen, Caen, Montauban, and Camp (a small
hamlet near Abbeville) of France, and in the archives
of the cities of Lausanne and Geneva of Switzerland.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Tristan</span> and <span class='sc'>Pierre De Camp</span> of Lusigran de la
Cabé les Pezenas, district of Beziers, were received as
inhabitants of Geneva on 7th January 1555.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jean de Camp</span>, a saddler, was killed at Rouen during
the St. Bartholomew massacre, August 1572.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Noel de Camp</span>, a nobleman, Seigneur de La Boudrie,
was received as an inhabitant at Geneva on 4th September
1572.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jean de Camp</span>, a native of Montauban, setting out
from Moulins (about 1572) with two gentlemen, was
seized and hung near that city, with his companions.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jean de Camp</span>, going from Tours, received a passport
on 2d July 1590.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Marthe (de) Camp</span> de Bombelles, born of a good family
of Montauban, married a Catholic officer in the
“Desert,” who wasted her marriage portion and then
abandoned her, alleging under the then law that his
marriage with a Protestant was a nullity. The unfortunate
woman was supported by a family named “Van
Robais” and her daughter “Charlotte” later married
one of that name.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Daniel de Camp</span>, son of Paul de Camp, a merchant at
Sedan and Marthe de La Croix, was born about 1643,
and became minister at Laon. He married at Charenton
on 11th June 1673, Marie, daughter of Mathew
Roguin and Margarite Bolduc. He was a member of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the Synod of Ile de France on 26th August 1677, and
minister of the church at Roncy 1677–79.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Moses de Camp</span>, of Montauban, was a student at the
faculty of the town in 1657. He became pastor of Mazamet
1659–68; was imprisoned several times in 1665 for
refusing to salute the Sacrament when passing in the
street; he died in February 1668.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Marie de Camp</span>, of La Rochelle, widow, aged 49 years,
with two children, was naturalized at London as Mary
de Camp on 21st November 1682, and was assisted there
1702–06.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Pierre de Camp</span>, of Pary le Monial in the Duchy of
Burgundy, was received as a refugee with others at
Lausanne on 21st August 1688. He was a copper-smith
and died there on 1st March 1705 aged 64 years.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Laurent de Camp</span> was Seigneur of Bernoville
(Picardie or Normandie) in 1746.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>There appears to have been a large family of “Du
Campe” located in the neighborhood of Boulogne from
1475, but it is uncertain whether they were of same
family as the Protestant “De Camps.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span><span class='sc'>Huchon du Camp</span> owned a fief in the county of Boulogne

<p class='c005'>In “Recherche Genealogiques sur les contés de Boulogne,
etc., Tome I., pp. 312,” is mentioned a family of
“Du Campe” in Boulogne who had the arms on a shield
of silver, two bars, red. The ancestry is as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'>“<span class='sc'>Jean Rolant Du Campe</span>, married to Marie de Euyl,
was the father of <i>Martin</i>, 1482; ——, of Bois-le-Duc,
father of <i>Robert</i>, married at Montreuil in 1538 first to
Helene Gressier, daughter of Antoine and Peronne du
Camp and second to Jacqueline Le Bois (remarried to
Gabriel de Lozieres). He had by his first marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><i>Nicholas</i>, Sieur de Hubert, who married at Montreuil in
1569 Laurence de Lozieres, the daughter of his stepmother,
whence he had issue <i>Francois</i> and <i>Jeanne</i>, the wife
of Jean Le Vasseur. <i>Francois</i>, Sieur de Cambremont,
married in 1617 Jacqueline Lesseline, daughter of
Pierre, Sieur de La Malotterie, captain and high bailiff
of Samer, and Agnes Bertrand, and had issue <i>Philippe</i>
and <i>Louis</i>, priest of the Oratory of Boulogne.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Philippe</i>, Sieur de Tardinghen and Longueville,
musketeer of the king, attached to the regiment of the
marines, married at Calais 24 February, 1672, Adrienne
Marguerite Lepigault, daughter of Nicolas, Sieur de
Vertesalle, mayor and judge-consul of Calais, and
Jeanne Pollart (Nobillaire de Rousseville), and had issue
<i>Louis</i>, esquire, Sieur of Tardinghen, Ostove, Longatte,
La Teutrie and Noir-Bonningue, who purchased in 1710
the estates of Frency and Rosamel paying 46,050 pounds
for the inheritance of Monseigneur Augustine de
Gouffier, Count of Rosamel. He married in 1696 Antoinette
Catherine Carpentier, daughter of Antoine, Sieur
of Lespagnerie and Catherine de Courteville d’Hodieg.
He was master of the waters and forests at Boulogne,
and the father of many children. From him descended
the present Du Campes of Rosamel, allied to the La
Rue, Le Blond de Plouy, Cacheleu d’Houdan, etc.,
among whom were <i>Daniel Antoine</i>, lieutenant in the
Liannois regiment in 1729; <i>Claude Louis Marie</i>, marshal of
the camp in 1789; and in the present century a rear-admiral,
minister of war, father of another rear-admiral,
a son of whom is at the present time commander of a
vessel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There are many references concerning these “Du
Campes” in the archives of the Department Pas du
Calais at Arras, from which may be learned the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>facts: <i>Francois</i> and <i>Jacqueline (Lesseline) Du Campe</i> had
issue <i>Guillaume</i>, eldest son, an advocate at Sarlement,
and later Sieur of Cambremont; <i>Philippe</i>, second son,
baptized at parish of St. Joseph on 9 November, 1646,
his godfather being Philippe de Crequy, Chevalier-Seigneur
de Hesmont, Souverains Moulins, Wimille, and
other estates; <i>Francoise</i>, a daughter, who signed a marriage
contract with Regnaut Destailleur, Knight, Sieur
de Questreque, on 10 September, 1659, and had a child,
Marie Francoise Destailleur, married to Bertrand de La
Haye, Seigneur de la Houssaye, on 27 January, 1684, by
Louis, priest of the Oratory; <i>Louis</i>, who was priest of
the Oratory at Boulogne, and died 8 November, 1700.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Philippe and Adrienne (Lepigault) Du Campe</span> had
a son <i>Louis</i> and a daughter <i>Nicolle</i>, who married Jean de
Lafontaine, Sieur Dufart.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Louis and Antoinette (Carpentier) Du Campe</span> had
a son <i>Louis Antoine</i> baptized 15 April, 1697, and a son
<i>Francois</i>, baptized 10 October, 1712.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Daniel Antoine Du Campe</span>, squire and Seigneur de
Rosamel, was married on 7 January, 1727, to Marie
Marguerite de la Rue du Rosny, by Louis Claude Du
Campe, priest of the parish of St. Joseph, and had a son
<i>Daniel</i>, baptized on 20 September, 1729–30.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Claude Louis Marie Du Campe</span>, Chevalier, Seigneur
de Rosamel, Chevalier of St. Louis, Major of the Royal
Navarre Regiment, married Marie Armande Cecile de
St. Martin, who died 17 February, 1765, aged 19 years.
He was also Seigneur of Frency, Seguian, Journy,
Lamotte, Courteville, and Zelucy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Claude Charles Marie Du Camp de Rosamel</span> was
born at Boulogne 1774 (?), was minister of marine, and
died 19 March, 1873.</p>

<p class='c005'>In addition to above “Du Campes” clearly related to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the great Du Campe family of Boulogne, we also find
the following mentioned in the Arras archives:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jean Descamps</span> (sic) living at Boulogne, a son of Jean

living at the hamlet of Partel, gave a donation to Marie
Rose Jacques, her daughter, of furniture situated at
Bienvillon-au-Bois on 11 October, 1741.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Louise Marie Du Camp</span>, living at Brumembert, signed
a contract of marriage with Adrien Gardin, laborer,
living at same place, on 11 January, 1755.</p>

<p class='c005'>In “Le Cabinet Historique” (Indicateur Armorial
d’Houzier, Charles Rene), edition 1866, may be found the
names of those “De Camps” entitled to bear coat-armor
about 1650. The list is as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jean André de Camps</span>, Counsellor to the Presidial of
Pamiers. Arms: On a shield azure a chevron with two
roses in chief and a wheat sheaf in point, all in gold.
(Montpellier, vol. 15, fol. 1483.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jacques de</span> or <span class='sc'>du Camp</span>, notary in the district of
Lauvan. Arms: On a shield sinople (the color green in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>English heraldry) a chief fessy, gold and sable. (Montpellier,
vol. 15, fol. 1483.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Francois de Camps</span>, Abbe de Ligny. Arms: On a
shield azure, a lion gold holding in his two front paws
a shield, sable. (Paris, vol. 24, pt. ii., fol. 1137.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Laurent de Camps</span>, Chief Surgeon of the King’s Hospitals
at Maubeuge. Arms: On a shield azure three
trefoils, gold, 2 and 1. (Flanders, vol. 12, fol. 1438.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Etienne des Camps</span>, scribe of the king at the gallery
called La Forte. Arms: On a shield azure a crescent
gold between two towers silver, placed front, three stars
gold ranged in chief, and three ducks, also gold, ranged
in point, swimming on a river of silver. (Provence, vol.
29, pt. i., fol. 668.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jacques de Camps</span>, bourgeois. Arms: On a shield
azure two towers silver, jointed sable, accompanied in
point by a dog, gold, running after a hare, gold, on a
meadow, silver, and a chief gules charged with three
gold stars. (Provence, vol. 29, pt. i., fol. 818.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Bertrand de Camps</span>, Procureur Audit of Parleement;
Capitoul (municipal officer of Toulouse). Arms: On a
shield azure a chevron gules, accompanied in chief by
dots azure, and in point by a lion of sable, tongued and
armed gules and a chief, azure, charged with three silver
stars. (Toulouse, vol. 14, pt. i., fol. 137.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Pierre de Camps</span>, esquire, Seigneur de Clairbourg, and
former body guard to the king, Valet of the Wardrobe
to Monsieur (the Dauphin). Arms: On a shield azure
a chevron gules, accompanied by three merlets of sable.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the above facts it will be noted that there existed
a large family of Protestant “De Camps” at Montauban
between 1625–1675; a great Catholic family of “Du
Campe” at Boulogne between 1600–1780, and an indication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of “De Camps” at Rouen. Perhaps a clue to the
ancestry of the New Jersey “De Camp” family may
lurk about that Laurent De Camps who was Chief Surgeon
at Mauberge and that Laurent De Camps who was
Sieur de Bernoville in 1746. The fact of a Maurice Descamps
being a witness to the marriage of his brother
Jean Descamps and Catherine Delarre on 28 September,
1681, may also be important, as this Maurice was a son
of Jean and Margueritte (Chevalier) Descamps, deceased
in 1681, and it will hereafter be seen that the name of
Morris is a favored one in the early New Jersey De
Camp families.</p>

<p class='c005'>The purpose of the present work is to trace and record
the descendants of “Laurens Jansen De Camp,”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> a
French Huguenot, who arrived in this country about
1664, and appears to have been the first and only one of
his name who came to the shores of the New Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fixed'>1</span> <span class='sc'>Laurence<sup>2</sup> De Camp</span>, the son of <i>John<sup>1</sup> De Camp</i>, was
probably born either in the province of Picardie or Normandy
about 1645. He arrived at New Amsterdam in
1664, in company with other Huguenots, from Holland;
but the name of the vessel in which he crossed the ocean
is unknown. Dr. Charles W. Baird, in his “History of
the Huguenot Refugees in America,” states that his fellow-emigrants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>were Antoine du Chaine, Nicolas de La
Plaine, Jean de la Warde, all of Normandy; and Simon
Bouclé, Jacques Monier, Pierre Monier, Gedeon Merlet,
Jacques Cossart, and Jean Paul de Rues. In the early
Dutch church records he is repeatedly called “Laurens
Jansen,”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> but in 1687 his full name, “Laurens Jansen
De Camp,” appears on the Kings County, N. Y., rolls.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>He must have been quite young at the date of his
emigration for he married about 1676 Elsie de Mandeville,
daughter of Gillis and Altje (Hendricks) de Mandeville<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
(also written Mandeviel), and had most if not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>all his children born within the period of from 1676–1696.
In the Assessment Roll of New Utrecht made up
24th August, 1675, his name appears as “Laurens Jansen
1 Pole, 2 Horses, 2 Cows, £52; 24 Morgens of Land
£48; Total; £100;” and in the Assessment Roll of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>same place made up 29th September, 1676, he appears as
“Laurens Jansen 1 Pole; 2 Horses; 2 Cows; £52; 12
Morgens of Land; £24; Total £76.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1677 the names “Laurens Jansen and wife” appear
in a list of church members at New Utrecht, N. Y., and
he undoubtedly lived at this place from 1664 to 1688, for
on the 26th September, 1687, his name appears on a list
of these inhabitants of Kings County, N. Y., who took
the oath of allegiance to England as follows: “Lawrens
Janse De Camp 23 Jaere” (Doc. Hist. of N. Y., vol. I., p.
415), (that is, he had been in New Netherlands 23 years)
of New Utrecht, N. Y. Shortly after this date he must
have removed to Staten Island, N. Y., where there was
a large Huguenot settlement and a French church established
as early as 1680. On 30th December, 1701, he
joined in a Petition of the Protestants of New York to
King William III. (N. Y. Col. Mss., vol. IV., p. 942),
entitled “A list of the maj<sup>r</sup> part of the freeholders
and inhabitants of Richmond County” “Johannes de
Campe; Larrens de Campe.” The John De Camp here
mentioned was his eldest son. In 1719, May 7th, he was
Local Pastor of the Staten Island Dutch Church. On 20
June, 1679 “Laurens Janz &amp; Altie Gillis” his wife, were
the witnesses at baptism of Maria, the child of Antoine
Du Chesne and Anna Bocque at Flatbush, N. Y. On
5th May, 1688, Laurens Jansen and Altie Gillis, his wife,
were the witnesses at baptism of Angenetie, child of
Hendrik Jansen Cammega and Anna Maria Vervele at
Flatbush, N. Y.</p>

Henry De Camp was a contractor early in life and later
ran a line of sloops between Troy and New York. He
failed in business, however, and retired to Greenport,
Long Island, where he died. In the Evening Mirror, 1
Aug. 1853, N. Y., is the following: “Henry De Camp,
a soldier of the Revolution, died at Greenport, L. I., on
the 26th inst. (July) aged<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> 96 years.” There is a tradition
that in 1775 at the outbreak of the Revolutionary
War he was 14 years of age, and immediately enlisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and served all through the war. This would apparently
place his birth at 1761. In the N. Y. Herald of Monday,
1st August, 1853, the following obituary notice
appears:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Henry De Camp, a soldier of the Revolution, died
at Greenport, L. I., on the 26th ult., aged 96 years.
Mr. De Camp was born in New Brunswick, N. J. When
he was yet a mere youth the Revolution commenced and
he joined a company raised at New Brunswick. At the
close of the war he learned the trade of a carpenter, and
commenced business at Troy, N. Y., at which place he
settled when there were only six or seven houses there.
He built the first Presbyterian Meeting House erected
there. He would have been astonished could he have
visited Troy to have seen to what it had grown. For the
last twenty-five years he has resided at Greenport, L. I.
Out of a large family only four children survive him,
and fourteen grand, twenty-three great grandchildren,
and one great great grandchild.” Henry De Camp’s
wife was a sister of Mary Frear, who married Dr. Alexander

<p class='c005'>“On Thursday, 24th inst. John De Camp, aged 84
years. This upright and energetic man was a soldier
of the Revolution. At the early age of 16 he commenced
an active career of military enterprise and was
soon engaged in the perils and glories of the scenes
immediately following the retreat of General Washington
across New Jersey. He was present in numerous
engagements with the enemy. His personal conduct
secured for him the approbation of many well known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>officers, under whom he served. For two years he was
constantly exposed to the dangers and privations of
active service. He then joined a body of men known as
express riders attached to the Quartermaster-General’s
Department. In this capacity he soon became personally
known to Gen. Washington, who on many occasions
thereafter during a period of three years, entrusted
him with despatches for Congress and for his general
officers. In all his military duties he invariably
acquired the confidence of his general commander, and
the fact of his being constantly employed in the immediate
service of Gen. Washington is a sufficient guarantee
of his character. With his life as a private citizen we
have less to do. It is enough to say that he was eminently
successful. He was remarkable for industry,
activity and probity. For 27 years he occupied a seat
on the judicial bench of his native state, New Jersey.
At a later period he came to reside in this city, and
in the numerous circles of acquaintances he commanded
the respect and esteem of all who knew him to value
the great Christian virtues of benevolence, integrity,
and truth. His funeral will take place on Sunday afternoon,
the 27th inst., from his late residence No. 13
Grove Street, at half-past four o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—(A.) One Gerrit Jansen Van Campen and Machtelt
Stoffels, his wife, had a child Jan, baptized at Kingston,
N. Y., on 18 April 1661. Witnesses: Jacob Jansen
Van Campen; (undoubtedly a brother), Juriaen Westvaal,
Marytjen Hansen, and Tryntje Tyssen Bos.
From this child Jan sprang all the Kingston, N. Y.,
and Somerville, N. J. families of “Van Campen”
descendants of which settled in Schawangunk, Minisink,
and Delaware Water Gap.</p>

<p class='c005'>On 11th June 1667 one Jan Smedes sued Gerrit van
Campen in the New Amsterdam Mayors Court and on
17th December 1667 Bartholomew van den Schol sued
him in the same court.</p>

<p class='c005'>One Gerrit Jansen Van Campen bought a house and
lot at Flushing, N. Y., of Peter Jansen Schol on 27
November 1688 (Liber C. page 45 Flushing Register
Office). It seems a fair assumption to regard this Gerrit
Jansen Van Campen of Kingston, New York, and Flushing
as one and the same person, and that Jacob Jansen
Van Campen, who was a witness at the baptism at
Kingston, 1661, was probably a brother.</p>

<p class='c005'>(B.) There was a Gerrit Janzen Van Campen, who
had a wife Aeltje Pieter Lamberts, and a child Cornelia,
baptized at N. Y. Dutch Church on 1st January 1655.
Witness Emmetie Van der Slüys. The name of the
witness inclines one to believe that Gerrit Janzen Van
Campen was closely related to the following party.</p>

<p class='c005'>(C.) Lambert Hendrickson Van Campen in 1664 took
the oath of allegiance at New Amsterdam, and was
assessed later as living in “Marketfield Alley.” He
and his wife Barbetje Barents, had a child Hendrick,
baptized in N. Y. Dutch Church, 9 November 1661.
Witness: Marritie Van der Slüys.</p>

<p class='c005'>(D.) One Jan Martyn Van Campen had a child Johannis,
baptized in N. Y. Dutch Church, 4 April 1660.
Witnesses: Nicasius de Sille and housewife, and Pieter
Montfort. This man was in command of a privateer
and is mentioned in N. Y. Colonial records.</p>

that Nicholas Camp who went from Wethersfield to
Milford, Conn., in 1639, and had a son or a grandson,
William Campe, who removed to Newark, N. J., about
1665. Not the slightest proof of such relationship exists,
and upon none of the Milford, Conn., or Newark, N. J.,
records dealing with this Camp family does the prefix
“De” appear. Moreover, it is well established that the
Milford Camp family was of English origin.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—There were several of the early inhabitants
of New Amsterdam who were called “Laurens Jansen”
on the records, none of whom can be identified
with our “Laurens Jansen De Camp.” It is interesting,
however, to trace out such of these “Laurens Jansen”
worthies as can clearly be followed.</p>

<p class='c005'>(A.) In a list of early immigrants the following
appears: 1659 February, In the Faith, “Laurens Janssen
from Wormer” (Documentary History of New York,
vol. III.) The same man appears on the N. Y. Dutch
Church records as follows: “1666 May 6, Laurens Janzen
j. m. van Wormer in Noorthollt en Annetje Jans wed<sup>e</sup>
van Lucas Elderzen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>(B.) On the same church record also appears one Laurens
Jansen who had a wife Marritie Aldrichs, and children
baptized Maritje, 1672 April 16; Annetje 1674 July
8; Albert 1676 November 11; Wyntje 1679 April 23;
Neeltje 1682 May 20; Jan 1685 April 29; Belitje 1693
June 18.</p>

<p class='c005'>(C.) In a list of those who took the oath of allegiance
at New Utrecht, N. Y., on 26th September 1687, appears
one “Laurens Janse, natur” who also appears later in
a list of inhabitants of New Utrecht, 1698, as having a
wife, three children, and two slaves. (Hist. of Kings
Co.) He it is who, on Brooklyn Dutch Church records
appears as follows: “1696 Jannetje, child of Laurens
Janse and Hendrikje Jacobse; Witnesses Stoffel Gerritse
and Annetje Jans,” and also in a deed “Laurens Jansen
and Hendrickse, his wife, both of the Yellowhook,
Town of New Utrecht, Kings Co. N. Y. to William
Matysen of Brooklyn N. Y.,” dated 8 May 1708, consideration
£412–0 Acknowledged 21 March 17¹⁸⁄₁₉ recorded in
Liber 4 of conveyances page 207 Kings Co. Registers
Office conveying land on Yellowhook consisting of 66
acres. It is this Laurens Jansen that Mr. Tunis G.
Bergen confounds with our Laurens Janz (de Camp) in
his work (Early Settlers of Kings Co.), and has erroneously
attributed to him several of the children of our
Laurens Janz de Camp. A careful examination of the
names of parents and witnesses on the original Flatbush
and Brooklyn Dutch Church records (Onderdonk’s copy,
in Long Island Hist. Soc.) shows the excusable error of
Mr. Bergen. It is a curious fact, however, that our
Laurens Janz de Camp and this Laurens Jansen should
both live at New Utrecht between 1670–1700.</p>

<p class='c005'>(D.) Another Laurens Jansen appears indirectly in N.
Y. Dutch Church records, viz.: “1659 June 19 Jan
Gervon van Beaumont in Walslant, Soldaet en Lÿsbeth
Hendricks Wed<sup>e</sup> van Laurens Janzen Deenmarken” (<i>i. e.</i>
a Dane).</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, then, we find no less than four other Laurens
Jansen in New Amsterdam living contemporaneously
with our Laurens Jansen De Camp and apparently in
no way related to him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Elsie de Mandeville was the daughter of
Gillis Jansen de Mandeviel from Garder, Holland, who
emigrated to New Amsterdam in February, 1659, on the
ship De Trouw (Faith), a private trader going to Manhattan,
which sailed 13 February, 1659, with near one
hundred passengers, but no French except one—“De
Ruine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It has been suggested that this single French emigrant
was Laurens Jansen de Camp “de Rouen,” <i>i. e.</i>,
that the passenger whose name is left blank or cannot
be deciphered in the original list was “from Rouen,”
a city in the province of Normandy, France. While
there is no substantial proof of the above contention it
is based upon reason as it is known that Laurens Jansen
de Camp came from Normandy, and that there was a
De Camp family in that city, one member of which,
Jean de Camp, a saddler, was killed there during the
St. Bartholomew massacre, August 1572.</p>

<p class='c005'>The name “Gillis Janzen” erroneously appears in a
list of passengers on the ship “Moesman” which sailed
in April, 1659, and it was long supposed that this was
another person of the same name. (Doc. Hist. of N. Y.)
An examination of the original document now on file at
Albany, N. Y., proves conclusively that this “Gillis
Janzen” is recorded not as a passenger, but as one itemized
in the ship manifest against whom a charge is made
for a small sum of money advanced by the direction of
the Dutch West India Company. Gillis Jansen de Mandeville
brought over with him his wife Altje (Pieters or
Hendricks), and four children, viz.: (1) Hendrick Gillis,
born in Gelderland; (2) Gerretje Gillis; (3) Aeltje Gillis;
(4) Jan Gillis; and it is presumed that two children
(5) Tyntje Gillis, and (6) David Gillis, were born later at
Flatbush, N. Y. He died between 1696–1701, leaving
a will dated 15th September 1696, proved 1701, in New
York County, Liber 2 of Wills, page 109. In it he calls
himself of Greenwich, N. Y. (an outlying district of the
city), and mentions his wife Elsie Mandeville, eldest son
Hendrick, son David, daughter Tynte, wife of Corn
Jansen De Veer (should be “van der Veer”), daughter
Altje, wife of Lawrence Johnson (meant for Laurens
Jansen de Camp), daughter Perette, wife of Peter Mutt;
daughter Geritie, wife of John Muthel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The original will, on file in the New York Surrogate’s
Office, is written in English, and bears a wax seal upon
which a coat of arms or crest can be traced, resembling
a horse rampant.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The above Laurence De Camp has been
placed as a son of Gideon<sup>3</sup> (Laurence<sup>2</sup>, John<sup>1</sup>), but there
is no proof that such was his descent. The fact of his
marriage date being about 1752 would indicate that he
was not identical with Laurence<sup>4</sup> De Camp (Gideon<sup>3</sup>,
Laurence<sup>2</sup>, John<sup>1</sup>), baptized at Staten Island 1719, June 7.
Witnesses Laurence de Camp and Altje Mandeviel.
But he has been so placed until future data proves this
assumption true or erroneous.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The names of children of Aaron<sup>5</sup> De Camp
not mentioned in will were furnished by Geo. E. De
Camp, of Roseland, N. J., his great-grandson.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The name of his son Eliphalet<sup>6</sup> is not mentioned

17 September, 1823, and recorded in Newark, N. J., in
Book P2, page 542.</p>

<p class='c005'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—He may be identical with that Enoch De

<p class='c005'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—At Troy, N. Y., the Rev. Jonas Coe baptized
a Sally de Camp on 2 November, 1816; a Christina

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—If he was aged 96 at death it would make
his birth 1757. This, however, is an error for he was
baptized 1764, and probably was born at earliest in
1763. The fact is curious as showing how erroneous a
family statement of old age can be.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—There is a curious family tradition that the
Rousseaus were related to the philosopher Jean Jacques
Rousseau of France, and that the ancestor of Dr. Alexander
Rousseau and the ancestor of Henry De Camp
came over in the same ship from France. The Rousseau
family claim that the father of Dr. Alexander Rousseau
was born in Bordeaux, France, and was the first of
his name to come to America. All the “De Camp”
data, however, is to the contrary, and goes to disprove
the Rousseau traditions and claims, and the ancestors
of Henry De Camp had been in America since 1664.
There is a strong probability that the Troy “Rousseau”
family were closely related to, if not identical with the
great “Roosa” family of Kingston, N. Y., which intermarried several times with the Freer family of New
Paltz and Kingston, N. Y., and when the members of
said “Roosa” family removed to Troy the name was
corrupted or changed to “Rousseau.” Curiously enough
there were “Rousseau” and “Rozet” names recorded
in N. Y. French Church records about 1680, and the
Staten Island Dutch Church record contains a birth record
of a child of one Peter Ruisseau and —— Mesereau.
As Staten Island Church records contain many De Camp
names this is a significant coincidence.</p>

<p class='c005'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—An admirable compilation of these Ohio De
Camp families has been made by James M. De Camp,
of Cincinnati, Ohio, entitled “Record of the Descendants
of Ezekiel and Mary Baker De Camp, of Butler
County, Ohio,” which was printed and published by the
Western Methodist Book Concern, Cincinnati, O., in
1896 (pages 177), and to which reference is directed. As
a record has been made of these De Camps of Butler Co.,
the compiler of the within work has not incorporated
this branch of the general De Camp family into the
present compilation.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—It may be that this Gideon<sup>6</sup> De Camp was
not a son of Morris<sup>5</sup> De Camp (John<sup>4</sup>, Henry<sup>3</sup>, Laurence<sup>2</sup>,
John<sup>1</sup>). He could not be identical with Gideon<sup>4</sup> (Henry<sup>3</sup>,
Laurence<sup>2</sup>, John<sup>1</sup>), baptized 1721, May 21, or with Gideon<sup>4</sup>
(Gideon<sup>3</sup>, Laurence<sup>2</sup>, John<sup>1</sup>) baptized 1727, Oct. 15. He
is clearly a grandson of Henry<sup>3</sup> (Laurence<sup>2</sup>, John<sup>1</sup>), but
the fact that he was a physician in good circumstances
owning several valuable tracts of land at Elizabeth,
Westfield, and Rahway, is indicative that he might not
be identical with the Gideon<sup>6</sup> (Morris<sup>5</sup>, John<sup>4</sup>, Henry<sup>3</sup>,
Laurence<sup>2</sup>, John<sup>1</sup>) mentioned in Sheriff’s Deed, Isaac
Ward, Sheriff, to Moses Jacques, dated 11 Jan. 1804,
recorded Newark Registry in Book H. of Deeds, page
522, as one against whose land a judgment writ of fi. fa.
was issued and under which the land was seized and sold.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. <span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The above De Camp line was furnished by
James A. De Camp of 95 Reade street, N. Y. city, who
states that perhaps Elihu De Camp was a son of Lemuel
De Camp. This, however, the lineal descendants of
Lemuel De Camp deny, and no mention is made of such
a son in the will of Hannah De Camp, widow of said
Lemuel De Camp. Mr. De Camp further states that
Elihu De Camp had another daughter Mary, but if so
she is not mentioned in either her father’s or mother’s
will. It therefore remains to trace out the father of
Elihu De Camp.</p>
